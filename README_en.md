<h2>CourseGraph: Automatic Construction of Course Knowledge Graphs Using Large Models</h2>

<p>
    <a href="README.md">Chinese</a> | <b>English</b>
</p>
</div>

CourseGraph utilizes large language models and various prompt optimization techniques to automatically extract knowledge points from textbooks and books, forming a knowledge graph centered around courses, chapters, and knowledge points. To enrich each knowledge point, CourseGraph can link relevant exercises, extended reading materials, and other resources. Additionally, it can leverage multimodal large models to extract information from pptx files, images, and videos, establishing connections with the knowledge points.

## ü§î Limitations

- Currently, only basic knowledge graph extraction and pptx parsing have been implemented, with room for optimization
- Video parsing is still in the planning phase

## üìà Future Development

- Improve prompt engineering and explore using Agents for related tasks
- Knowledge graph-based question answering (KBQA or Graph-RAG)

## üöÄ Quick Start

First, obtain an Alibaba Cloud Tongyi Qianwen [API Key](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/get-api-key?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.1be847bbvv6p4o), then choose local installation

### Local Installation

#### Install Dependencies

Ensure Anaconda (or Miniconda) and Rust are installed, then execute:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CPU-DS/CourseGraph.git
cd CourseGraph
conda create -n cg python=3.10 -y
conda activate cg
pip install poetry
poetry config virtualenvs.create false
poetry install
cd rust
maturin develop
cd ..
```

> On Linux, libreoffice is required for document conversion. For Debian-based systems: `sudo apt install libreoffice`

Then locate the file `examples/get_knowledge_graph.py`

#### Configure Graph Database

The project uses Neo4j as the graph database. You'll need to provide the connection address and credentials. If not installed, please refer to the [Neo4j documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/)

#### Execute

```bash
python examples/get_knowledge_graph.py
```

## üìö Documentation

Documentation can be found in the `docs` directory, or you can visit the [online documentation](https://CPU-DS.github.io/CourseGraph/) (As the project features are still under rapid development, the online documentation is not yet ready). If you wish to customize the online documentation, follow these steps:

#### Install Dependencies and Preview

The documentation is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), requiring Node.js 18 or above. Execute:

```bash
cd docs
npm i
npm run docs:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to preview

#### Deployment

Online documentation is deployed using Github Actions + Github Pages, with the workflow file at `.github/workflows/docs.yaml`
